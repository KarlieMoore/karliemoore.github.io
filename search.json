    "title": "Did Nebraska Really Deserve to Win the 1997 College Football Championships?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "There’s nothing quite like a good ol’ fashion college football rivalry to get fans in an uproar! Whether it’s Army vs Navy, Michigan vs Ohio State, or Oklahoma vs Texas, college football will always draw the biggest debates amongst fans about which team is the best. Perhaps the greatest dispute in college football history happened in 1997 when the Nebraska Huskers, with a record of 13-0, and the Michigan Wolverines with a 12-0 season, split the National Championship the year before the start of the Bowl Championship Series. Here is the 26-year-old question: Who was actually the better team? They never met each other on the field but were both deemed champs. Ultimately, the National title was given to the Nebraska Huskers who won the Coaches’ Poll. Most Michigan fans will claim that was only because Tom Osborne retired and had nothing to do with who was actually better. If the two teams had played in 1997, how would it unfold? Who would win what has been named “The Game of the Century That Never Was?”\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(cowplot)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggbump)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nConferences <- read_csv(\"data/Conferences.csv\")\nNEBGames <- read_csv(\"data/1997NEBSchedule.csv\")\nMICHGames <-read_csv(\"data/1997MICHSchedule.csv\")\nOffense <- read_csv(\"data/StatsOffense.csv\")\nDefense <- read_csv(\"data/StatsDefense.csv\")\nRankings <- read_csv(\"data/Rankings.csv\")\n\n\nWhile both the 1997 Nebraska and Michigan teams didn’t play each other, they did play a couple of the same teams during the course of their season. By examining the results of these games, it may give some indication of whether the Huskers were the true 1997 champs. Both Nebraska and Michigan played Colorado. As seen by the data in the waffle chart, it is clear that Michigan defeated Colorado by a greater margin. Nebraska won 27-24 over Colorado, while the Wolverines defeated them by a score of 27-3, a much larger margin of a win. Are there other things to consider in when comparing these games? Definitely. For example, did Colorado have more injuries and bigger players out during the Michigan game than during the Nebraska game? Does when they played their games have an impact? Michigan convincingly defeated Colorado on September 13, 1997, while the Huskers win came on November 28, 1997. Did Colorado progress and get better and stronger as the season progressed giving Nebraska a better challenge? While there are things that may play a role, it is clear that Michigan’s win over Colorado is too much greater to ignore. Perhaps it proves a stronger defense than the Huskers.\n\n\nCode\nNEBvsCU <- c(\"Nebraska\"=27, \"Colorado\"=24)\nMICHvsCU <- c(\"Michigan\"=27, \"Colorado\"= 3)\n\nwaffle1 <- waffle(\n  NEBvsCU,\n  rows=8,\n  title= \"Nebraska vs Colorado 1997\",\n  xlab= \"1 square = 1 point\",\n  colors = c(\"red\",\"darkgreen\")\n) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 8, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 6),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\nwaffle2 <- waffle(\n  MICHvsCU,\n  rows=8,\n  title= \"Michigan vs Colorado 1997\",\n  xlab= \"1 square = 1 point\",\n  colors = c(\"blue\",\"darkgreen\")\n)+\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 8, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 6),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\nplot_grid(waffle1, waffle2) + \n  labs(\n    title= \"Nebraska and Michigan Both Played Colorado in 1997\", \n    subtitle = \"Nebraska and Michigan both played Colorado during the 1997 season\"\n  )+\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the 1997 season, Nebraska and Michigan also both played Baylor. Nebraska defeated the Baylor Bears 49-21 on October 11. Michigan took a win from Baylor by a score of 38-3 on September 20. Again, a bigger win by the Wolverines than the Huskers. However, some claim this game irrelevant since other factors, again, come into play. Michigan played Baylor at home and Nebraska played them on the road, and the standard 3.5 point home field advantage swing wipes out Michigan’s 7 point difference, rendering those Baylor performances the same. So…I guess we are not much further ahead at answering who was actually the better team.\n\n\nCode\nNEBvsBaylor <- c(\"Nebraska\"=49, \"Baylor\"=21)\nMICHvsBaylor <- c(\"Michigan\"=38, \"Baylor\"= 3)\n\nwaffle1 <- waffle(\n  NEBvsBaylor,\n  rows=8,\n  title= \"Nebraska vs Baylor 1997\",\n  xlab= \"1 square = 1 point\",\n  colors = c(\"red\",\"darkgreen\")\n) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 8, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 6),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\nwaffle2 <- waffle(\n  MICHvsBaylor,\n  rows=8,\n  title= \"Michigan vs Baylor 1997\",\n  xlab= \"1 square = 1 point\",\n  colors = c(\"blue\",\"darkgreen\")\n)+\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 8, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 6),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\nplot_grid(waffle1, waffle2) + \n  labs(\n    title= \"Nebraska and Michigan Both Played Baylor in 1997\", \n    subtitle = \"Nebraska and Michigan both played Baylor during the 1997 season\"\n  )+\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only two similar games Michigan and Nebraska played in 1997 were Colorado and Baylor, which really weren’t the strongest teams in either division. Perhaps comparing the strength and difficulty of each team’s overall season will help determine who was really the best team in the nation. When looking at comparing all of the teams in both the Big 10, Michigan’s Conference, and the Big 12, Nebraska’s Conference, Michigan had a tougher go, having the 6th most difficult season schedule, while the Huskers had the 10th ranked level of difficulty. Nebraska played four teams ranked in the top 25 while Michigan would play seven teams ranked in the top 25. When comparing the teams played, Michigan played 6 teams in the regular season that earned Bowl berths. Nebraska only played four teams to qualify for Bowl Games. However, of those six teams that faced the Wolverines, they all went 0-6 in their Bowl matches, while the four teams the Huskers played went 2-2 in their Bowl Games. Another reason the teams were “co-champions” in 1997. Even their seasons schedules and outcomes appear to be equal.\n\n\nCode\nnu <- Conferences %>%\n  filter(\n    School== \"Nebraska\"\n  )\n\nmi <- Conferences %>%\n  filter(\n    School== \"Michigan\"\n  )\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=Conferences, aes(x=reorder(School, SOS), weight=SOS), fill= \"grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=nu, aes(x=reorder(School, SOS), weight=SOS), fill= \"red\") +\n  geom_bar(data=mi, aes(x=reorder(School, SOS), weight=SOS), fill= \"blue\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x= \"Team\",\n    y= \"Strength of Schedule\",\n    title= \"The Wolverinnes Had A Harder Season Than the Huskers\",\n    subtitle= \"Every team in the Big 10 and Big 12 and their Strength of Schedule \",\n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference College Football | By Karlie Moore\"\n  )+\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nAre final scores the only way to determine the best team, or is how they play the game an indication of success? In football, how the ball is advanced up the field can give an indication of true skill. By examining Nebraska and Michigan’s passing and rushing game for the 1997 season, a final determination of the true National Champion might arise. Is controlling the rushing or passing game better for victory? In the football world, there is the great debate about whether passing or rushing is the measure of true skill. It is believed by some football enthusiasts that the rushing game is positively correlated with the probability of winning. Some say many teams will run or rush the ball to take time off the clock, but there is the argument that throwing the ball on offense gains more yards. During the 1997 season, the Huskers played a much stronger rushing game than the Wolverines, while Michigan had close to equal rushing and passing yards. While at first glance it may look like the Huskers should be the better team, you have to consider that they may have spent more time rushing the ball because their scores were closer,and they were trying to just end the games safely with a win. Michigan may have more passing yards because they were winning by larger margins and didn’t feel the need to run the ball as much. So, it’s a draw!\n\n\nCode\nOYards <- Offense %>%\n  group_by(School) %>%\n  summarise(\n    SeasonRushingYards = sum(RushYds),\n    SeasonPassingYards = sum(PassYds)\n  )\n\nOYardsWide <- OYards %>%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols=starts_with(\"Season\"),\n    names_to = \"Type\",\n    values_to = \"Yards\"\n  )\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=OYardsWide, aes(x=School, weight= Yards, fill= Type)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(name=\"Offensive Yards\", values=c(\"blue\", \"red\")) + \n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x= \"School\",\n    y= \"Season Rushing Yards vs Passing Yards\",\n    title= \"Nebraska vs Michigan Offensive Strategies\",\n    subtitle= \"Nebraska did much better in Rushing Yards while Michigan excelled in Passinng Yards\",\n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference College Football | By Karlie Moore\"\n  )+\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nPassing and rushing success can be determined when the teams are on defense as well. With a quick glance at the bar graph, Nebraska and Michigan were close to even in defensive rushing yards, with Michigan barely winning this comparison. Nebraska clearly superseded Michigan in passing yards. So, Nebraska was stronger in rushing yards on offense while Michigan was more successful in passing yards. Nebraska wins when it comes to passing yards on defense, but Michigan trumps Nebraska in rushing yards on defence. These teams possibly couldn’t have been more even.\n\n\nCode\nDYards <- Defense %>%\n  group_by(School) %>%\n  summarise(\n    SeasonRushingYards = sum(RushYds),\n    SeasonPassingYards = sum(PassYds)\n  )\n\nDYardsWide <- DYards %>%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols=starts_with(\"Season\"),\n    names_to = \"Type\",\n    values_to = \"Yards\"\n  )\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=DYardsWide, aes(x=School, weight= Yards, fill= Type)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(name=\"Defensive Yards\", values=c(\"blue\", \"red\")) + \n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x= \"School\",\n    y= \"Season Rushing Yards vs Passing Yards\",\n    title= \"Nebraska vs Michigan Defensive Strategies\",\n    subtitle= \"The teams were pretty evenn in rushing yards, but Nebraska had more passing yards\",\n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference College Football | By Karlie Moore\"\n  )+\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, the team schedules of the 1997 season don’t give us a definitive answer as to who were actually National College Football Champions. The scores in head-tohead games against similar teams doesn’t make it any clearer, and because of conflicting ideas about whether passing or rushing makes for a better team, we seem no further ahead in determining the best college football team of 1997. Maybe we can go to the experts. The Associated Press poll (AP poll) provides weekly rankings of the top 25 NCAA teams in Division I college sports football. The rankings are compiled by polling 62 sportswriters and broadcasters from across the nation. These are experts in the field who know college football inside-out, and who make their living deciding who is the best. As seen in the line graph, the Huskers took an early lead in the first four weeks, fell in the stats in week 5, came back on top for the next six weeks before the Wolverines were best in the National rankings for the final four weeks. What does this mean? Nebraska was first for 10 of the 15 weeks. Does this mean they essentially should be deemed the National Champions because of the poll. It looks pretty clear, but there are some faults with relying on these stats. Consider biases. Who knows if the sportswriters and broadcasters went to the schools they are ranking or have been a long-time fan? Another issue: College football provides only 12-13 games each season to evaluate a team. With this small sample size, teams can look much better by their record than they deserve. While the Huskers look to be the chosen season for the 1997 season, relying on opinions may not be the most accurate way to decide the real champs.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bump(data=Rankings, aes(x=Week, y=Rank, color=School)) + \n  geom_point(data=Rankings, aes(x=Week, y=Rank, color=School), size = 4) + \n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"red\")) +\n  scale_y_reverse()+\n  labs(\n    x= \"Week\",\n    y= \"Rankings\",\n    title= \"Huskers vs Wolverines Weekly National Rankings\",\n    subtitle= \"The Huskers remained ahead for a majority of the season, but were surpassed by Michigan in week 12\",\n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference College Football | By Karlie Moore\"\n  )+\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggsave(\"image.png\")\n\n\nI think this evidence proves one thing. Until two teams play each other, there truly is no 100 percent way to know who was better. The fans of the Big House will always believe it is Michigan, and the fans that pack Memorial Stadium weekends in the Fall will stand by their Huskers as the true National Champions of the 1997 season. And while I have my own opinion (Go Big Red!), I fear that the question of who were actually the National Champs will stay a great college football mystery."

    "title": "Do Batting Average and On Base Percentage Determine the Most Successful Teams in the MLB?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I have been to a number of MLB baseball games living a full country away, yet only 15 minutes from the Detroit Tigers Comerica Park. The last game I went to in the summer of 2022, the Tigers were hitting “the leather off the ball,” as my brother would say. They had the bases loaded a few times throughout the game, but they lost.\nThe goal of baseball, of course, is to score more runs that your opposition. This can only be achieved with strong bats, strategic hits, and sometimes a little bit of luck. Wouldn’t it make sense that the team who has the better batting average and players that get on base more would be the victors?\nWhen analysing the batting averages and on base percent of MLB teams for the 2022 season, it is interesting to compare the final standings with the batting averages and on base percent of the teams. Did the most successful teams have the most impressive stats when it comes to batting averages and on base percent? Did the teams at the bottom of the barrel have the worse stats?\nLet’s start by examining batting averages. Which teams had the best batting averages and how did they finish in the standings for the season?\nBatting average is calculated as the number of hits divided by the number of times at bat. The Toronto Blue Jays, New York Mets, and Boston Red Sox were 1, 2, 3 in Batting Average in 2022 of the 30 teams in the MLB. How does this compare to their season results? Both Toronto and New York finished second in their divisions, the America League East and National League East respectively, but Boston, with the third best team batting average were last in the American League Division. What does this mean? While the Red Sox were able to pound the ball, they weren’t able to close the deal and score the runs on base, so while they look good at the plate while hitting, they couldn’t seem to find their way back to the plate after getting on base.\nAnother interesting fact when looking at the graph is that the 2022 MLB Champions, the Houston Astros are about halfway down the pack when it comes to batting average. Perhaps batting average is not an overall accurate indicator of overall success.\nHits turn into base running, so perhaps looking at on base percent will help explain success.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(cowplot)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nMLBTeamStats <- read_csv(\"data/2022MLBTeamStats.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nbar1 <- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=MLBTeamStats, aes(x=reorder(Tm, BA), weight=BA), fill= \"blue\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x= \"MLB Teams\",\n    y= \"Batting Average\",\n    title= \"2022 MLB Batting Average and... \",\n    subtitle= \"MLB Batting Average for the 2022 season\",\n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference MLB Baseball | By Karlie Moore\"\n  )+\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 13, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 6),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\nbar2 <- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=MLBTeamStats, aes(x=reorder(Tm, OBP), weight=OBP), fill= \"red\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x= \"MLB Teams\",\n    y= \"On Base Percentage\",\n    title= \"... On Base Percentage \",\n    subtitle= \"MLB On Base Percentage for the 2022 season\",\n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference MLB Baseball | By Karlie Moore\"\n  )+\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 13, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 6),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\nplot_grid(bar1, bar2)\n\n\n\n\n\nBaseball experts would argue that on base percent is a more reliable and more accurate measure of success that a batting average, as base percent takes into account all of a player’s plate appearances, including walks, hits by a pitch, and sacrifice hits. So, is this an accurate statement? Did the teams with the best base percent have more success?\nOf the top six teams in the on base percent results, five of them finished first or second in their respective divisions. On base percent does seem to be a better predictor of overall success than batting average, but still does not guarantee success. The Houston Astros, 2022 MLB champs, had better on base percent than batting average ranking 7th.\nNow let’s look at the stats combined. Do teams with the best batting average also have the highest on base percent?\n\n\nCode\nTop <- MLBTeamStats %>%\n  filter(\n    Tm == \"Los Angeles Dodgers\" |\n    Tm == \"New York Mets\" |\n    Tm == \"Toronto Blue Jays\"\n  )\n\nBottom <- MLBTeamStats %>%\n  filter(\n    Tm == \"Oakland Athletics\" |\n    Tm == \"Pittsburgh Pirates\" |\n    Tm == \"Detroit Tigers\"\n  )\n\nHoustonAstros <- MLBTeamStats %>%\n  filter(Tm == \"Houston Astros\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=MLBTeamStats, aes(x= BA, y= OBP)) +\n  geom_smooth(data=MLBTeamStats, aes(x=BA, y= OBP), method=\"lm\", se=FALSE) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=Top,\n    aes(x=BA, y=OBP, label=Tm), colour=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=Bottom,\n    aes(x=BA, y=OBP, label=Tm), colour=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=HoustonAstros,\n    aes(x=BA, y=OBP, label=Tm), colour=\"red\") +\n  geom_encircle(\n    data=HoustonAstros,\n    aes(x=BA, y=OBP), s_shape=.01, expand=.006, colour=\"red\") +\n labs(\n    x= \"Batting Average\",\n    y= \"On Base Percentage\",\n    title= \"2022 MLB Teams Batting Average Compared to On Base Percentage \",\n    subtitle= \"Do MLB teams with a higher batting average also have a better on base percentage?\",\n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference MLB Baseball | By Karlie Moore\"\n  )+\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 13, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nIt appears so. The LA Dodgers and NY Mets have both the highest batting averages and on base percentages, while the Pirates and Oakland A’s are scraping the bottom of the barrel on both counts. In terms of season success, these stats make sense, as the Dodgers were first and the Mets second in their divisions, while Pittsburg and Oakland both finished last in theirs. While the Pirates and Oakland did not make post season, play-offs, the La Dodgers and New York Mets did.\nWhat if we took away the trips to first base that were not actually hits by the batter? If walks and hits-by-pitches is removed from the equation, slugging percent speaks to the true batting skill of a team. Do slugging percentages with On Base Percent identify the most successful teams? The natural thought process would be that the best hitting teams that get on base would be most successful, and these stats seem to prove that. The LA Dodgers, Toronto Blue Jays, Atlanta Braves, and New York Yankees rank as the top four teams when it comes to slugging and on-base percent. All of these teams finished first in their divisions with the Blue Jays finishing second behind the Yankees. These guys are getting on base and sending their teammates for runs! Kind of the point of baseball. Ironically enough, only one of these teams made it to the final four of the MLB 2022 play-offs. The saying, “Stats don’t lie” tends to be true when it comes to baseball, but you still have to show up when it matters!\n\n\nCode\nOPS <- MLBTeamStats %>% \n  select(Tm, OBP, SLG) %>%\n  pivot_longer(cols = -Tm, names_to = \"Stat\", values_to = \"Percent\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=OPS,aes(x=reorder(Tm, Percent), weight= Percent, fill=Stat))+\n  scale_fill_manual(name=\"OPS\", values=c(\"blue\", \"red\")) + \n  coord_flip() +\nlabs(\n    x= \"On-Base plus Slugging\",\n    y= \"Team\",\n    title= \"Are The Top MLB Teams Making it Around the Bases or Just On-Base?\",\n    subtitle= \"The BA and OBP shows that teams can get on base, but can they hit hard to get around the bases or is it all luck?\",\n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference MLB Baseball | By Karlie Moore\"\n  )+\ntheme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 11, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 7),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion? There is a correlation between batting averages and on base percent, and while those teams who score high in both areas are more likely to have more success than those whose results are lower, it doesn’t guarantee championships. Again, the 2022 MLB champions, the Houston Astros were not the best in either category or both combined, but in the end, they took home the hardware!"
